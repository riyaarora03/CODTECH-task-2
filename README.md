## WHAT I LEARNT
This project has been an incredible learning experience, pushing me to implement advanced functionalities and create a seamless user experience. Here are some highlights:   

**Advanced Functionalities**: I've integrated real-time updates, infinite scroll, and content recommendations to ensure a dynamic and engaging user experience.   
**Comprehensive Design**: Building a full-stack application required careful planning and design, from front-end interfaces with React to robust back-end systems using Node.js and Express.js.   
**User-Centric Features**: Developing user profiles, friend connections, news feeds, and multimedia sharing has enhanced my understanding of user engagement and interaction.   
**Database Management**: Working with MySQL Workbench for database design and management provided invaluable insights into data organization and retrieval.   
**Authentication and Security**: Implementing JWT and bcrypt for secure authentication and data protection was a critical part of the project, ensuring user privacy and security.
